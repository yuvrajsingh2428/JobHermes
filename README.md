## 📊 Scoring Algorithm

Jobs are scored 0–100 across 6 dimensions:

| Dimension | Max Points | What It Measures |
|---|---|---|
| Skill Match | 30 | Overlap between job requirements and your skills |
| Title Match | 20 | How closely the job title matches your target roles |
| Location | 15 | Match against your preferred cities / remote preference |
| Experience | 15 | Whether required years matches your experience |
| Salary | 10 | Whether stated salary meets your minimum |
| Prestige | 10 | Company reputation (curated list of top-tier companies) |

## 🗄️ Database Schema

```sql
jobs              -- All scraped + scored job postings
applications      -- Application tracking (resume, CL paths, outcome)
scan_runs         -- History of each daily scan
report_log        -- History of generated reports
```

---

## 🤖 AI Pipeline

1. **Relevance Filter** → GPT checks if each job is relevant before storing
2. **Daily Summary** → GPT writes a human-readable summary of the day's scan
3. **Resume** → GPT tailors your profile to match the specific job description
4. **Cover Letter** → GPT writes a compelling letter with your chosen tone

## 📝 Adding More Job Sources

Edit `config/company-targets.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "YourTargetCompany",
  "careers_url": "https://company.com/careers",
  "search_keywords": ["software engineer", "backend"],
  "priority": "high",
  "enabled": true
}
```

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** – Type-safe backend
- **Node.js** – Runtime
- **OpenAI SDK** – GPT-4o for AI features
- **better-sqlite3** – Fast synchronous SQLite
- **node-cron** – Cron scheduling
- **axios + cheerio** – HTTP scraping (TinyFetch layer)
- **dotenv** – Environment variable management
- **uuid** – Task ID generation

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- **Scraping**: Many company career pages are dynamic (React SPA). For those, you'll need to extend the scraper with Playwright/Puppeteer. The current TinyFetch implementation handles SSR/static pages well.
- **Rate Limiting**: `REQUEST_DELAY_MS` (default 1500ms) adds a polite delay between requests. Do not set below 1000ms.
- **API Costs**: GPT-4o calls are made per scan for summary generation. Use `gpt-4o-mini` to reduce costs for filtering.
